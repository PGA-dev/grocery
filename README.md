# grocery

## Portfolio Project

### PGA

### Origins
The impetus of the project started as an attempt to create a grocery list app, similar to ones I use regularly, with a twist: the budget element that I could never find in the other apps. The true realization of the project will obviously be in the mobile app department, so during the React Native section of NuCamp's Full Stack program I intend to stretch this into a more useful app.

This is actually the second iteration of this project, as the first was bogged down with way to much feeder code from NuCamp. I re-wrote most of the apps from scratch and used a few instructionals from Real Python to help get the basic pathing and structure down.

### Technologies
1. Docker containers and imaging
2. Django (using native Django html templates -- all css and html are from scratch or customized from templates)
3. SQLite3 for database
4. Python for all backend Django work
5. Git Hub
6. Docker superuser admin site 
7.pytest and unnitest
