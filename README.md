# Grocery with Notes

## NuCamp: Back End with Python Portfolio Project

### PGA

### Origins
The impetus of the project started as an attempt to create a grocery list app, similar to ones I use regularly, with a twist: the budget element that I could never find in the other apps. The true realization of the project will obviously be in the mobile app department, so during the React Native section of NuCamp's Full Stack program I intend to stretch this into a more useful app.

This is actually the second iteration of this project, as the first was bogged down with way to much feeder code from NuCamp. I re-wrote most of the apps from scratch and used a few instructionals from Real Python, GforGeeks, and a few NuCamp instructionals to help get the basic pathing and structure down. I wrote most of the templates and css from fairly simple front end design strategies, using Django script over existing javascripting that I am used to; the front end was a bit of a learning ideal, to get Django's framework learned.

### Overview
The app creates the opportunity to wed a fully functional grocery list program with a system of budget notes and text based notes. Very simple to use, it improves upon the functionality of a regular grocery list as it also logs the time you add each item, so there is no confusion week to week. 
#### Basic Functionality:
* Add Grocery items
* Update Grocery items
* Delete Grocery items
* Editable Notes section
* Editable price and projected budget sections
* Date tracking 

### Technologies
1. Docker containers and imaging
2. Django (using native Django html templates -- all css and html are from scratch or customized from templates)
3. SQLite3 for database
4. Python for all backend Django work
5. Git Hub for source control and versioning
6. Docker superuser admin site 
7.pytest and unnitest to keep the code honest


## Future Design and Implimentation
The app will likely need a more permanent front end; the Front end design program at NuCamp will likely be giving me a lean toward React to accomplish this goal. I would also like to impliment a user login and max budget requirements, using another app, gaining the ability to use the app in conjunction with overall budget programs or banking.
